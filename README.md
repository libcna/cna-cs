# CNA.NET

> **Status: exact public metadata for the selected XNA 4.0 Windows runtime profile; not yet
> behaviorally complete or release-ready.** The strict comparison reports 256/256 types, zero
> differences, zero CNA leaks, and an empty allowlist. The binding targets CNA C ABI 0.46.0.

CNA.NET is the C#/.NET binding for [CNA](https://github.com/libcna/cna), a native C++ game
framework. Its intended path is:

```text
C# XNA-style game
        ↓
CNA.XnaCompat   Microsoft.Xna.Framework public facade
        ↓
CNA.Framework   idiomatic CNA managed implementation
        ↓
CNA.Interop     internal P/Invoke boundary
        ↓
CNA C ABI → CNA C++
```

XNA source compatibility is the priority. CNA's native headers determine available backend
capabilities; authoritative XNA assemblies/documentation determine the managed public contract.
Binary compatibility with Microsoft's strong-named assemblies is not the primary goal.

## Measured state

As of 2026-10-04, against CNA `next` `8a7e13ff5` (C ABI 0.44.0), OPENGLES3 with
`CNA_EASYGL_COMPILED_EFFECTS=ON`, Linux x64:

- Debug and Release solution builds: success with one existing xUnit analyzer warning, 0 errors;
- managed tests in each configuration: 653/653 Framework, 319/319 XNA-compat, and 5/5
  BrowserCompat;
- native integration tests in each configuration: 260/260, plus 24/24 GamerServices, Avatar and
  Net integration tests
  (their own process: the native dispatcher is process-wide, as XNA's is);
- strict metadata profile: 256 reference types versus 256 target types, 0 differences, 0
  allowlisted; GamerServices/Avatar/Net profile: 75 reference versus 75 target types, 0
  differences;
- ABI: 1419 imports, all resolving; `tools/abi-verify` measures 1137 native/managed layout values
  with 0 mismatches, compiles all 1419 prototypes, checks 23 callback shapes and asserts 604
  constants; the
  `cna-cs-native-abi/1` matrix accepts exactly 0.44.0 and 12 isolated fixtures pass (2 accepted, 10
  rejected). See [`docs/native-abi-compatibility.md`](docs/native-abi-compatibility.md).

macOS (Apple silicon, osx-arm64), measured 2026-10-09 against CNA `a3da0a5bb` (C ABI 0.46.0),
SOFTWARE with `CNA_DEVICES=ON` and `CNA_SOFTWARE_COMPILED_EFFECTS=ON`, SDL's dummy video driver
(CNA `plans/plan_apple_m4.md` AM4-215..AM4-231):

- Debug and Release solution builds: success with the one existing xUnit analyzer warning, 0
  errors;
- managed tests in each configuration: 652/655 Framework (3 skip by name on a case-insensitive
  filesystem), 319/319 XNA-compat, 5/5 BrowserCompat;
- native integration tests in each configuration: 261/261, plus 24/24 GamerServices, Avatar and
  Net integration tests; the ownership stress program, 100 cycles in Debug and Release;
- ABI: `Verify-Abi` 0 mismatches, the fixture matrix 2 accepted and 11 rejected, the macOS
  `libcna_c_api.dylib` passes the runtime contract;
- package acceptance for `osx-arm64` passed (see [`docs/packaging.md`](docs/packaging.md));
- METAL, from a Release C API with `CNA_METAL_COMPILED_EFFECTS=ON`: a C# XNA game on the process
  main thread reads back exactly what it drew (clear, SpriteBatch, render target, BasicEffect); a
  fresh `dotnet new cna-game` reports METAL and draws 60 and 600 frames; all 84
  `cna-dotnet-samples` with a project start and keep running in Cocoa windows. The test suites
  above run windowless because xUnit creates games on worker threads, where macOS refuses a
  windowed renderer.

The campaign plan and running evidence ledger is [`CAMPAIGN.md`](CAMPAIGN.md). Earlier measurements
are in [`NEXT.md`](NEXT.md) and Git history; treat them as history, not current state.

## Build and test

Requires .NET 8 or later.

```bash
dotnet restore CNA.sln
dotnet build CNA.sln -c Debug --no-restore
dotnet build CNA.sln -c Release --no-restore
dotnet test tests/CNA.Framework.Tests/CNA.Framework.Tests.csproj
dotnet test tests/CNA.XnaCompat.Tests/CNA.XnaCompat.Tests.csproj
```

Native integration tests skip cleanly when CNA is unavailable. To run them explicitly:

```bash
CNA_NATIVE_LIBRARY=/path/to/libcna_c_api.so \
  xvfb-run -a dotnet test tests/CNA.Integration.Tests/CNA.Integration.Tests.csproj
```

On macOS the library is `libcna_c_api.dylib`, and the run stays off the desktop under SDL's dummy
video driver instead of `xvfb-run` -- a windowless renderer such as SOFTWARE draws there, and xUnit
creates games on worker threads, where macOS would refuse a windowed renderer anyway:

```bash
CNA_NATIVE_LIBRARY=/path/to/lib/libcna_c_api.dylib SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
  dotnet test tests/CNA.Integration.Tests/CNA.Integration.Tests.csproj
```

The loader also accepts `CNA_NATIVE_DIR`. Explicit configuration is fail-fast and takes precedence
over package-native lookup. Admission follows
[`cna-cs-native-abi/1`](docs/native-abi-compatibility.md), not a same-major range: the version must
have a reviewed matrix entry, all 1419 imports must exist, and signature/shape canaries must pass.
The one accepted entry today is C ABI 0.46.0.
Wrong ABI, missing symbols, conflicts, wrong architecture/load failure, and missing-library cases
report the attempted configuration, consumer/detected ABI where available, RID, and remediation;
`CNA_NATIVE_DIAGNOSTICS=1` enables low-level loader details.

## Strict API verification

Supply legally obtained XNA 4.0 reference assemblies without adding them to this repository:

```bash
dotnet build CNA.sln -c Release
XNA_REFERENCE_PATH=/path/to/xna-reference-assemblies \
  dotnet run --project tools/api-compat -c Release --no-build -- --format text
```

Exit codes are 0 for a clean/reviewed contract, 1 for unallowlisted differences, and 2 for bad
configuration. `--format json` and `--format github` support automation; `--leak-only` requires no
XNA reference assembly. The checked-in allowlist is intentionally empty.

The sibling `cna-dotnet-template` is the richer CNA-first demonstration and installable `dotnet new`
template (`cna-game`).

## Architecture and packaging

Public XNA hierarchy takes priority over implementation inheritance. Corrected families use
composition and internal adapters so one native resource has one owner. The selected strict
profile now has no public `CNA.*` base types or public/protected CNA-type signature leaks.
